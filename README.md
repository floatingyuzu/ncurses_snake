ncurses_snake
=============

A simple C++ game using ncurses - classic Snake

I have been using the StanfordCPPLib library during my C++ study. I decided to use this with ncurses_snake.  

vector.h and random.h are the only libraries actually used - it wouldn't be difficult to recode for the standard C++ libraries.

Do not forget -lncurses when building.
